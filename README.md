Arduino-Based Water Turbidity Monitoring System
A low-cost, embedded system designed to assess water quality by measuring its turbidity (cloudiness) using an analog turbidity sensor.

🚀 Project Overview
This system provides a digital alternative to subjective visual assessment of water clarity. It reads analog voltage values from a turbidity sensor, converts them into meaningful Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU), and can be used for continuous water quality monitoring.

🛠️ Hardware Components
Microcontroller: Arduino Nano / Uno

Sensor: Analog Turbidity Sensor Module

Output: 16x2 LCD Display (or Serial Monitor)

Power: 9V Battery or USB

⚙️ Software & Technologies
Embedded Programming: Arduino (C++)

Libraries: LiquidCrystal (for LCD)

Tools: Arduino IDE, Multimeter (for calibration)

🔧 Key Features
Analog Sensor Interfacing: Reads and processes analog voltage signals.

Calibration: Can be calibrated against known standards for accurate NTU readings.

Data Display: Shows results on an LCD screen in real-time.

Serial Output: Data can also be logged via the serial port for further analysis.

🧪 Calibration & Usage
Calibrate with Clear Water: Immerse the sensor in clear water and note the analog value.

Test Sample: Place the sensor in the water sample to be tested.

Read Value: The system calculates the turbidity level based on the calibrated values.
